# FEATURES

SOLHunt is a lightweight pixel Play To Earn dungeon game built on the Solana Blockchain, built with Phaser. Our motivation is to enable users to own what you earn

**GAME DATA IS STORED ON-CHAIN WHICH MEANS THAT THE USER CAN'T COLLECT TREASURE (SPL TOKENS) PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED**
- ðŸŽ® Secure authentication with phantom wallet
- ðŸŽ® In Game Store
- ðŸŽ® NFT rewards as Level Passes
- ðŸŽ® $DUN(SOLHunt) Token Rewards as Loot (SPL token)
- ðŸŽ® Auto save game progress on chain
- ðŸŽ® Metaplex Game storefront for buying game characters and using them as game assets as NFT. Every character is Rare and has unique abilities.
- ðŸŽ® Decentralised storage powered by ARWEAVE
- ðŸŽ® Swap $SOL for $DUN(game token), on serum DEX swap (ALPHA) in game to deposit token in escrow to play (COMING SOON)
- ðŸŽ® SOLHunt DAO to reward game-artists assets through voting on Solana using $DUN token.
